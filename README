To create vagrant base box -
-----------------------------
1. Execute the following command on -

# packer build base_image-0.1-x86_64.json

2. Check the list of installed boxes in vagrant

# vagrant box list

3. To use the newly created basebox we need to add it to vagrant

# vagrant box add --name baseimage ./builds/base_image-0.1-x86_64.json
# vagrant box list

4. Test this box

Option 1:  # vagrant init baseimage
           [This creates a Vagrantfile and append this line in the file since VMware Tool has not installed automatically]
	   # config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", type: "rsync"
           # vagrant up

Option 2: # Create Vagrantfile
          # Add ```csbasebox.vm.box = "csbasebox"```
	  # Vagrant up
